# CSCE-315-Project3
### Picky Eats: A web application that allows users to view recipes based on ingredients they have as well as related recipe names. It also displays nutritional information about the recipes. It allows users to view their recommended calories using a BMI API. The web application allows the users to print out the recipes they add to their list or save them in pdf format. 

API Mash-Up
## Project as of 4/11/21
We created a node.js application and uploaded it onto the heroku app. We also implemented the backend for the Kroger and spoonacular API. We are having trouble dealing with node.js in front and back end of the application. We also had trouble with Kroger and Walmart API. Kroger API won't display the price and Walmart API requires us to apply for the API and wait period. We are thinking about switching it to Python and using other APIs that would fit our project.

## Project as of 4/18/21
We have switched our project to Python/flask back and front end instead of node.js. We are also using fitness-api, and nutrition-x api instead of walmart and kroger. We switched our idea a bit to go more of a nutrition type of website instead of focusing mainly on price. We implemented functions for the two new APIs in python and turned our spoonacular code into python code from node.js.


## Project as of 4/25/21
We have implemented all of our base qualifications from our APIS. We are able to access all our APIs and display the information we needed. We are able to display recipes, add ingredients (with recommendations), select and store recipes, display and alter the daily calories. We plan to incorporate the changes from the user study and fix some of the errors and bugs we currently have.

## Project as of 5/2/21
We have finished designing the website and it should be fully functional at the following link: https://glacial-retreat-25879.herokuapp.com/ .
